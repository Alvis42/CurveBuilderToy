# Documentation Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots and visualizations for the Interest Rate Curve Builder project.

## Current Files

- `interpolation_comparison.png` - Comparison of different interpolation methods (linear, cubic, log-linear)

## Planned Screenshots

The following screenshots are referenced in the main README.md but need to be created:

- `dashboard.png` - Main Streamlit dashboard interface
- `curve_builder.png` - Curve building interface
- `pricing.png` - Instrument pricing interface

## How to Create Screenshots

1. Run the Streamlit app: `python3 main.py --streamlit`
2. Navigate to each section
3. Take screenshots using your system's screenshot tool
4. Save as PNG files in this directory
5. Update the main README.md with the actual screenshots

## Note

The current README.md has been updated to use feature descriptions instead of broken image references until actual screenshots are available.
